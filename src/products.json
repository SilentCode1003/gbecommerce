    "description": "A compact UPS with line-interactive topology, the CyberPower Intelligent LCD CP685AVRLCD provides battery backup (using simulated sine wave output) and surge protection for desktop computers, workstations, networking devices, and home entertainment systems. The CP685AVRLCD uses Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) to correct minor power fluctuations without switching to battery power, which extends battery life. AVR is essential in areas where power fluctuations occur frequently. Features include a multifunction LCD panel to provide visibility into power conditions and UPS vitals. The CP685AVRLCD comes with a three-year warranty (including coverage of batteries) and a 125,000 Connected Equipment Guarantee.",
